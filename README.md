# Detection_of_Surface_Cracks_using_Deep_Learning
Detection of Surface Cracks in Concrete Structures using Deep Learning

Todo:
- Add Sequential rather than one model to the last layer of pre-trained ResNet18
- Add transformation, e.g. RandomResizedCrop, CenterCrop, RandomRotation, RandomHorizontalFlip, RandomVerticalFlip, ColorJitter.
- Add dropouts.
- Test on images that are randomly found on internet.
- Highlight crack.
